variable: 
     its used to store data in memory location(name given to memory location)
     A python variable is a reserved memory location to  store values(in otherwords variable in python program gives data to computer for processing)
     A variable is created at the moment we first assign a value to it
     the value stored in the variable can be changed during program execution
     all operation done on the variable effects the memory location
     
     standard:
       A variable should be usuable name(related to project or task)
       ex prg:
         # a integer assignment
            age = 30
         #a floating point
         salary =  1450.7
     print(age)
     print(salary)
     
     try to use camel case as much as possible for long variable
     camel case will is the pep standard,it removes all spaces and change the case of firstletter in small case and others in upper case
     Example:
     input: Welcome to python
     output in camel case:welcomeToPython
           
     rules for creating variable
     
        A variable must start with letter or(_)
        (ex)
        age = 25
       first_name = ahmed
       pint(first_name,'is',age,'years old)
        #o/p: ahmed is 25 years old
             
        a variable name caanot  start with a  no
          (Ex)
          
       # 5 apples=100 (cannot assign this method because its started with no)
       apples_5=100
       print("price of 5 apple is",apple_5)
       #o/P:price of 5 apple is 100
       
        a variable name can only contain alpha numeric characters and(_)
        
         ex prg:(addition of two no)
        number_1= 10
        number_2= 5
        sum = number_1+number_2
        print(sum)  
         #o/p:sum=15
         
        the variable name are case sensitive
        (ex)
        name = sathya
        Name = nikesh
        print(name)
       # output is sathya
        print(Name)
       # output is nikesh
       
        the reserved word(keyword) caanot be used a variable name
        #we cannot assign for it else true these word as a variable name
        
        
      differnce between compailer and interpreter:
      
            Interpreter
				                                                      Compiler
		
Translates program one statement at a time.         
				                                        Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code.	
Interpreters usually take less amount of time 
to analyze the source code.
However, the overall execution time is comparatively         Compilers usually take a large amount of time to analyze the source code.
                                                                However, the overall execution time is comparatively faster than interpreters.
		
slower than compailer				                          
No Object Code is generated, hence are memory efficient.    Generates Object Code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory. 
				                                         
Programming languages like JavaScript, Python.
				                                          Programming languages like C, C++, Java use compilers.
		
       
        compailer working method:
        
                   preprocessing                    processing
       SOURCE CODE-----------------> OBECT CODE---------------------->MACHINE
       
       interpeter working method:
       
        
                   preprocessing                          processing

       KEYWORDS
  
        Keywords are predefined words given  by the interpreter
        each one has own identity and specific task
        there are 33 keywords in python
  rules:variable name shpuld not match with keyword
  
  some reserved keywords are:
  
  and: it performs logic and(compare two conditions)
  break:its used to terminate variable name in loop
  del: it is used delete the elements from list
  def: user defined function
  elif: else if function for mutiple function
  else:false statement
  except: it is used for exception handling
  class: its used for object oriented programm
  exec: its excute the python program dynamically
  finally: its similar like exec
  for: loop statement
  global: variable for both main anduser defined function
  if:for condition
  import: this keyword import the package to python program( ex: import.math)
  in: membership operator
  is:identity operator
  from: importing the subpackages

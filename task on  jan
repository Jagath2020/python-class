variable: 
     its used to store data in memory location(name given to memory location)
     A python variable is a reserved memory location to  store values(in otherwords variable in python program gives data to computer for processing)
     A variable is created at the moment we first assign a value to it
     the value stored in the variable can be changed during program execution
     all operation done on the variable effects the memory location
     
     standard:
       A variable should be usuable name(related to project or task)
       ex prg:
         # a integer assignment
            age = 30
         #a floating point
         salary =  1450.7
     print(age)
     print(salary)
     
     try to use camel case as much as possible for long variable
     camel case is the pep standard,it removes all spaces and change the case of firstletter in small case and others words first lettrer in upper case
     Example:
     input: Welcome to python
     output in camel case:welcomeToPython
           
     rules for creating variable
     
        A variable must start with letter or(_)
        (ex)
        age = 25
       first_name = ahmed
       pint(first_name,'is',age,'years old)
        #o/p: ahmed is 25 years old
             
        a variable name caanot  start with a  no
          (Ex)
          
       # 5 apples=100 (cannot assign this method because its started with no)
       apples_5=100
       print("price of 5 apple is",apple_5)
       #o/P:price of 5 apple is 100
       
        a variable name can only contain alpha numeric characters and(_)
        
         ex prg:(addition of two no)
        number_1= 10
        number_2= 5
        sum = number_1+number_2
        print(sum)  
         #o/p:sum=15
         
        the variable name are case sensitive
        (ex)
        name = sathya
        Name = nikesh
        print(name)
       # output is sathya
        print(Name)
       # output is nikesh
       
        the reserved word(keyword) caanot be used a variable name
        #we cannot assign for it else true these word as a variable name
        
        
      differnce between compailer and interpreter:
      
            Interpreter
				                                                      Compiler
		
Translates program one statement at a time.         
				                                        Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code.	
Interpreters usually take less amount of time 
to analyze the source code.
However, the overall execution time is comparatively         Compilers usually take a large amount of time to analyze the source code.
                                                                However, the overall execution time is comparatively faster than interpreters.
		
slower than compailer				                          
No Object Code is generated, hence are memory efficient.    Generates Object Code which further requires linking, hence requires more memory. 
				                                         
Programming languages like JavaScript, Python.
				                                          Programming languages like C, C++, Java use compilers.

       KEYWORDS
  
        Keywords are predefined words given  by the interpreter
        each one has own identity and specific task
        there are 33 keywords in python
      rules:variable name should not match with keyword
  
  some reserved keywords are:
  
  
  True, False, None

    True: This keyword is used to represent a boolean true. If a statement is true, “True” is printed.
    
    False: This keyword is used to represent a boolean false. If a statement is false, “False” is printed. 
    
    None:  special constant used to denote a null value. 
    It’s important to remember, 0, any empty container(e.g empty list) does not compute to None. 
    It is an object of its datatype – NoneType. It is not possible to create multiple None objects 
    and can assign them to variables.

example:
  print(False == 0)
  print(True == 1)
  
   print(True + True + True)
  print(True + False + False)
  
  print(None == 0)
  print(None == [])

Output

True
True
3
1
False
False

ieration Keywords – for, while, break, continue

    for: This keyword is used to control flow and for looping.
      example:
      Using for loop
for i in range(10):
  
    print(i, end = " ")
          
     
    break: “break” is used to control the flow of the loop. The statement is used to break out of the loop and passes the
    control to the statement following immediately after loop.
    
     # break the loop as soon it sees 6
     example:
    if i == 6:
        break
   print()
       
       while: Has a similar working like “for”, used to control flow and for looping.
    continue: “continue” is also used to control the flow of code. The keyword skips the current iteration of the loop but does not end the loop.

Example:
# square of given no
n=int(raw_input())
i=0
while(i<n)
print(i*i)
i+=1

#inputn=3
#output:
0
1
4

  
Conditional keywords – if, else, elif

    if : It is a control statement for decision making. Truth expression forces control to go in “if” statement block.
    else : It is a control statement for decision making. False expression forces control to go in “else” statement block.
    elif : It is a control statement for decision making. It is short for “else if“

Example: if, else, and elif keyword

 i = 20
if (i == 10):
    print ("i is 10")
elif (i == 20):
    print ("i is 20")
else:
    print ("i is not present")
Output: i is 20

def
def keyword is used to declare user defined functions.
Example: def keyword

# def keyword
def fun(): #function declaration
    print("Inside Function")
      
fun()  #function call

Output: Inside Function

Return Keywords – Return, Yield

    return : This keyword is used to return from the function.
    yield : This keyword is used like return statement but is used to return a generator.
    
 yield                                                 return
provide output and continue                      provides output and stop
it gives back genrators output                   it gives actual returned output
it keeps state of local variable                 it destroys the state of local variable
it does not exit the function                     it exist the function

class

class keyword is used to declare user defined classes.
class is blue print of obect or template

Example: Class Keyword

With

with keyword is used to wrap the execution of block of code within methods defined by context manager.
.
Example: With Keyword

# using with statement
with open('file_path', 'w') as file:
    file.write('hello world !')
as

as keyword is used to create the alias for the module imported. ( giving a new name to the imported module)
E.g import math as mymath.
Example: as Keyword

import math as gfg
  
print(gfg.factorial(5))

Output:120

pass

pass is the null statement in python. Nothing happens when this is encountered.
This is used to prevent indentation errors and used as a placeholder.
Example: Pass Keyword

n = 10
for i in range(n):
      
# pass can be used as placeholder
pass


Lambda

Lambda keyword is used to make inline returning functions with no statements allowed internally. 

Example: Lambda Keyword

# Lambda keyword
g = lambda x: x*x*x
  
print(g(7))
Output

343

Import, From

    import : This statement is used to include a particular module into current program.
    from : Generally used with import, from is used to import particular 

# import keyword
import math
print(math.factorial(10))
 Output:3628800
 
# from keyword
from math import factorial
print(factorial(10))
Output:3628800


PEP STANDARD:


PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. A PEP is a design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python
or its processes or environment. The PEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rational for the feature.

Python maintains a strict way of order and format of scripting.Following this sometimes mandatory and is a great help on the user’s end, to understand. 
Making it easy for others to read code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps tremendously for that.

For Python, PEP 8 has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style. 
Every Python developer should read it at some point.

Some important points:

1. Use 4-space indentation and no tabs.

    # First line contains no argument. Second line onwards 
    # more indentation included to distinguish this from  
    # the rest. 
    def function_name( 
            variable_one, variable_two, variable_three, 
            variable_four): 
        print(variable_one) 

2. Use docstrings : There are both single and multi-line docstrings that can be used in Python.
However, the single line comment fits in one line, triple quotes are used in both cases. These are used to define a particular
program or define a particular function.
Example:

    def exam(): 
        """This is single line docstring""" 
     
        """This is 
        a 
        multiline comment""" 

3. Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters : The Python standard library is conservative and requires limiting lines to 79 characters. 
The lines can be wrapped using parenthesis, brackets, and braces. They should be used in preference to backslashes.
Example:

    with open('/path/from/where/you/want/to/read/file') as file_one, \ 
         open('/path/where/you/want/the/file/to/be/written', 'w') as file_two: 
        file_two.write(file_one.read()) 

4. Use of trailing commas : This is not mandatory except while making a tuple.
Example:

    tup = ("geek",) 

5. Use Python’s default UTF-8 or ASCII encodings and not any fancy encodings, if it is meant for international environment.

6. Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs:

    a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4) 

7. Naming Conventions : There are few naming conventions that should be followed in order to make the program less complex and more readable. 
At the same time, the naming conventions in Python is a bit of mess, but here are few conventions that can be followed easily.


Blank Lines:

Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.

Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.

Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related functions. 
Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).

Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.

    Imports should usually be on separate lines:

    # Correct:
    import os
    import sys

    # Wrong:
    import sys, os

    It's okay to say this though:

    # Correct:
    from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

    Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants.

    Imports should be grouped in the following order:
        Standard library imports.
        Related third party imports.
        Local application/library specific imports.
	
String Quotes

In Python, single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the same. 
This PEP does not make a recommendation for this. Pick a rule and stick to it. When a string contains single or double quote characters, 
however, use the other one to avoid backslashes in the string. It improves readability.

For triple-quoted strings, always use double quote characters to be consistent with the docstring convention in PEP 257.


    # Correct:
    spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})

    # Wrong:
    spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } )

    Between a trailing comma and a following close parenthesis:

    # Correct:
    foo = (0,)

    # Wrong:
    bar = (0, )

    Immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon:

    # Correct:
    if x == 4: print(x, y); x, y = y, x

    # Wrong:
    if x == 4 : print(x , y) ; x , y = y , x

   
    Immediately before the open parenthesis that starts the argument list of a function call:

    # Correct:
    spam(1)

    # Wrong:
    spam (1)

    Immediately before the open parenthesis that starts an indexing or slicing:

    # Correct:
    dct['key'] = lst[index]

    # Wrong:
    dct ['key'] = lst [index]

    More than one space around an assignment (or other) operator to align it with another:

    # Correct:
    x = 1
    y = 2
    long_variable = 3

    # Wrong:
    x             = 1
    y             = 2
    long_variable = 3

Other Recommendations

    Avoid trailing whitespace anywhere. Because it's usually invisible, it can be confusing:
    e.g. a backslash followed by a space and a newline does not count as a line continuation marker. 
    Some editors don't preserve it and many projects (like CPython itself) have pre-commit hooks that reject it.

    Always surround these binary operators with a single space on either side: assignment (=), augmented assignment (+=, -= etc.),
    comparisons ,Booleans.

    If operators with different priorities are used, consider adding whitespace around the operators with the lowest priority. 
    Use your own judgment; however, never use more than one space, and always have the same amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary operator:

    # Correct:
    i = i + 1
    submitted += 1
    x = x*2 - 1
    hypot2 = x*x + y*y
    c = (a+b) * (a-b)

    # Wrong:
    i=i+1
    submitted +=1
    x = x * 2 - 1
    hypot2 = x * x + y * y
    c = (a + b) * (a - b)
    

    Function annotations should use the normal rules for colons and always have spaces around the -> arrow if present. 
    
    # Correct:
    def munge(input: AnyStr): ...
    def munge() -> PosInt: ...

    # Wrong:
    def munge(input:AnyStr): ...
    def munge()->PosInt: ...

    Don't use spaces around the = sign when used to indicate a keyword argument, or when used to indicate a default value
    for an unannotated function parameter:

    # Correct:
    def complex(real, imag=0.0):
        return magic(r=real, i=imag)

    # Wrong:
    def complex(real, imag = 0.0):
        return magic(r = real, i = imag)

    When combining an argument annotation with a default value, however, do use spaces around the = sign:

    # Correct:
    def munge(sep: AnyStr = None): ...
    def munge(input: AnyStr, sep: AnyStr = None, limit=1000): ...

    # Wrong:
    def munge(input: AnyStr=None): ...
    def munge(input: AnyStr, limit = 1000): ...

    Compound statements (multiple statements on the same line) are generally discouraged:

    # Correct:
    if foo == 'blah':
        do_blah_thing()
    do_one()
    do_two()
    do_three()

    Rather not:

    # Wrong:
    if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing()
    do_one(); do_two(); do_three()
    
    
    
When to Use Trailing Commas

Trailing commas are usually optional, except they are mandatory when making a tuple of one element.
For clarity, it is recommended to surround the latter in (technically redundant) parentheses:

# Correct:
FILES = ('setup.cfg',)

# Wrong:
FILES = 'setup.cfg',

Comments

Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments. Always make a priority of keeping the comments up-to-date when the code changes!

Comments should be complete sentences. The first word should be capitalized, unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case letter
(never alter the case of identifiers!).

Block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of complete sentences, with each sentence ending in a period.

You should use two spaces after a sentence-ending period in multi- sentence comments, except after the final sentence.


Documentation Strings

Conventions for writing good documentation strings (a.k.a. "docstrings") are immortalized in PEP 257.

    Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods. Docstrings are not necessary for non-public methods, 
    but you should have a comment that describes what the method does. This comment should appear after the def line.

    PEP 257 describes good docstring conventions. Note that most importantly, the """ that ends a multiline docstring should be on a line by itself:

    
Naming Conventions

Names that are visible to the user as public parts of the API should follow conventions that reflect usage rather than implementation.
Descriptive: Naming Styles

There are a lot of different naming styles. It helps to be able to recognize what naming style is being used, independently from what they are used for.

The following naming styles are commonly distinguished:

    b (single lowercase letter)

    B (single uppercase letter)

    lowercase

    lower_case_with_underscores

    UPPERCASE

    UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES

    CapitalizedWords (or CapWords, or CamelCase -- so named because of the bumpy look of its letters [4]). This is also sometimes known as StudlyCaps.

    Prescriptive: Naming Conventions
Names to Avoid

Never use the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.

In some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the numerals one and zero. When tempted to use 'l', use 'L' instead.
ASCII Compatibility


Exception Names

Because exceptions should be classes, the class naming convention applies here. However, you should use the suffix "Error" on your exception names (if the exception actually is an error).
Global Variable Names

(Let's hope that these variables are meant for use inside one module only.) The conventions are about the same as those for functions.

Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.

Always use cls for the first argument to class methods.


Use the function naming rules: lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.

Use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance variables.

To avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to invoke Python's name mangling rules.


Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. 
Examples include MAX_OVERFLOW and TOTAL.

Function Annotations

    Function annotations should use PEP 484 syntax.

    The experimentation with annotation styles that was recommended previously in this PEP is no longer encouraged.

    However, outside the stdlib, experiments within the rules of PEP 484 are now encouraged. For example, marking up a large third party library or 
    application with PEP 484 style type annotations, reviewing how easy it was to add those annotations, and observing whether their presence 
    increases code understandability.

    The Python standard library should be conservative in adopting such annotations, but their use is allowed for new code and for big refactorings.

    For code that wants to make a different use of function annotations it is recommended to put a comment of the form:

    
Varible Annotations

PEP 526 introduced variable annotations. The style recommendations for them are similar to those on function annotations described above:

    Annotations for module level variables, class and instance variables, and local variables should have a single space after the colon.

    There should be no space before the colon.

    If an assignment has a right hand side, then the equality sign should have exactly one space on both sides:

    # Correct:

    code: int

    class Point:
        coords: Tuple[int, int]
        label: str = '<unknown>'

    # Wrong:

    code:int  # No space after colon
    code : int  # Space before colon

    class Test:
        result: int=0  # No spaces around equality sign


  
  DATA TYPE:  
       clasification or categorization of data.
       variable use to reserve some space 
       in memory representation of data(int,float,char)
         a type reprenst two things about a variable
         what type of data allowed to store
         how much memory is required to store a data
         
          
      integers – This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal). 
      In Python there is no limit for length.
      
    Float – This value is represented by float class. It is a real number with floating point representation. It is specified by a decimal point.
        
    Complex Numbers – Complex number is represented by complex class. It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j.
    For example –( 2+3j)

example: 
#numeric value
  
a = 5
print("Type of a: ", type(a))
  
b = 5.0
print("Type of b: ", type(b))
  
c = 2 + 4j
print("Type of c: ", type(c))

Output:

Type of a:  <class 'int'>

Type of b:  <class 'float'>

Type of c:  <class 'complex

boolean:  it always check the condition and produce output true or false
  return or convert the value to the Boolean value 
	      

The bool method returns the following values.

    It returns True if a parameter or value passed is True.
    It returns False if a parameter or value passed is False.
    
    example.

Min = True
print(bool(Min)) 

Max = False
print(bool(Max)) 

x = 19
y = 11
print(bool(x==y))

output.

True
False
False

        
STRING:                       
        Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. A string is a collection of one or more characters
	put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote. In python there is no character data type, a character is a string of length one.
	its represented in str class.
	
	Creating String

Strings in Python can be created using single quotes or double quotes or even triple quotes.



# Python Program for 
# Creation of String 
    
# Creating a String  
# with single Quotes 
String1 = 'Welcome to python'
print("String with the use of Single Quotes: ") 
print(String1) 
    
# Creating a String 
# with double Quotes 
String1 = "hello world"
print("\nString with the use of Double Quotes: ") 
print(String1) 
print(type(String1))
    
# Creating a String 
# with triple Quotes 
String1 = '''hello world welcome to python''
print("\nString with the use of Triple Quotes: ") 
print(String1) 
print(type(String1))
  
# Creating String with triple 
# Quotes allows multiple lines 
String1 = '''hello 
            world 
            python'''
print("\nCreating a multiline String: ") 
print(String1) 

Output:

String with the use of Single Quotes: 
Welcome to the python

String with the use of Double Quotes: 
hello world
<class 'str'>

String with the use of Triple Quotes: 
hello world welcome to python
<class 'str'>

Creating a multiline String: 

            hello
	    world 
            python

 
accessing elements of String:

 String can be accessed by using the method of Indexing. Indexing allows negative address references to access characters 
 from the back of the String.

     OPERATORS:
     Operators are special symbols  that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. 
     The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.


     comparision operator:
     
     Comparison operators are used to compare values. It returns either True or False according to the condition.
     
Operator
						Example
		
>
				Greater than - True if left operand is greater than the right
				(x > y)
		
<
				Less than - True if left operand is less than the right
				(x < y)
		

==				Equal to - True if both operands are equal
				(x == y)
		

!=				Not equal to - True if operands are not equal
				(x != y)
		

>=				Greater than or equal to - True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right
				(x >= y)
		

<=				Less than or equal to - True if left operand is less than or equal to the right
				(x <= y)
		
Example :

x = 5
y = 10

# Output: x > y is False
print("x > y is",x>y)

# Output: x < y is True
print("x < y is",x<y)

# Output: x == y is False
print("x == y is",x==y)

# Output: x != y is True
print("x != y is",x!=y)

# Output: x >= y is False
print("x >= y is",x>=y)

# Output: x <= y is True
print("x <= y is",x<=y)

Output

x > y is False
x < y is True
x == y is False
x != y is True
x >= y is False
x <= y is True

Logical operators:

Logical operators are the and, or, not operators.


operator			meaning	
				
		

and				True if both the operands are true
				(x and y)
		

or				True if either of the operands is true
				(x or y)
		

not				True if operand is false (complements the operand)
				(not x)
		
Example:

x = True
y = False

print('x and y is',x and y)

print('x or y is',x or y)

print('not x is',not x)

Output

x and y is False
x or y is True
not x is False

Bitwise operators

They operate bit by bit.Bitwise operators act on operands as if they were strings of binary digits. 


Let x = 10 (0000 1010 in binary) and y = 4 (0000 0100 in binary)

operator				Meaning
						

&				Bitwise AND
				x & y = 0 (0000 0000)
		

|				Bitwise OR
				x | y = 14 (0000 1110)
		

~				Bitwise NOT
				~x = -11 (1111 0101)
		
^
				Bitwise XOR
				x ^ y = 14 (0000 1110)
		
>>
				Bitwise right shift
				x >> 2 = 2 (0000 0010)
		
<<
				Bitwise left shift
				x << 2 = 40 (0010 1000)
		
Assignment operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

a = 10 is a simple assignment operator that assigns the value 10 on the right to the variable a on the left.

There are various compound operators in Python like a += 5 that adds to the variable and later assigns the same. It is equivalent to a = a + 5.

operator		
				Equivalent to
		

=				x = 5
				x = 5
		

+=				x += 5
				x = x + 5
		

-=				x -= 5
				x = x - 5
		

*=				x *= 5
				x = x * 5
		

/=				x /= 5
				x = x / 5
		

%=				x %= 5
				x = x % 5
		

				x //= 5
//=				x = x // 5
		

				x **= 5
**=				x = x ** 5
		

				x &= 5
&=				x = x & 5
		

				x |= 5
|=				x = x | 5
		

^=				x ^= 5
				x = x ^ 5
		

>>=				x >>= 5
				x = x >> 5
		

				x <<= 5
<<=				x = x << 5



MEMBERSHIP OPERATORS:
		

      in and not in are the membership operators in Python. They are used to test whether a value or variable is 
      found in a sequence (string, list, tuple, set and dictionary).



operator				Meaning
				
		
in
				True if value/variable is found in the sequence
				(5 in x)
		
not in
				True if value/variable is not found in the sequence
				(5 not in x)
		
Example : program using string

x = 'Hello world'


# Output: True
print('H' in x)

# Output: True
print('python' not in x)

Output

True
True


TERNARY OPERATORS:

     Ternary operators are also known as conditional expressions are operators that evaluate something based on a condition being true or false. 
     
       note:  First the given condition is evaluated (a < b), then either a or b is returned based on the Boolean value returned by the condition.
    order of the arguments in the operator is different from other languages like C/C++ 
    Conditional expressions have the lowest priority compare than all python operations.


Example:
a=10
b=20


if a != b:
    if a > b:
        print("a is greater than b")
    else:
        print("b is greater than a")
else:
    print("Both a and b are equal")

Output:

 b is greater than a

PRINT:

Its used to display the output

The print() function prints the given object to the standard output device (screen) or to the text stream file.

Example

message = 'Python is fun'

# print the string message
print(message)


# Output: Python is fun

print() Syntax

The full syntax of print() is:

print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)


Example 1: How print() works in Python?

print("Python is fun.")

a = 5
# Two objects are passed
print("a =", a)


b = a
# Three objects are passed
print('a =', a, '= b')

Output

Python is fun.
a = 5
a = 5 = b


Hence,

    ' ' separator is used. Notice the space between two objects in the output.
    end parameter '\n' (newline character) is used. Notice, each print statement displays the output in the new line.
    file is sys.stdout. The output is printed on the screen.
    flush is False. The stream is not forcibly flushed.

Example 2: print() with separator and end parameters

a = 5
print("a =", a, sep='00000', end='\n\n\n')

print("a =", a, sep='0', end='')

Output

a =000005


a =05

We passed the sep and end parameters in the above program.

  VARIABLE
      variable are container for storing data values.
      python has no command for decalaring variable
      A variable is created the moment u first assign a value to it
      ex:
      x=5
      y="ram"
      print(X)
      print(y)
      casting:
      if you want specify the data type of variable
      ex: x=strstr(3),o/p x='3'
      y=int(3),o/p y=3
      z+float(3),o/p z=3.0
      in costant you cant change the memory location
      in variable you may change,we can assign value to the variable or we can re assign value to the same vriBLE(we can update the variable)
      
 DATA TYPE:  
       clasification or categorization of data.
       variable use to reserve some space 
       in memory representation of data(int,float,char)
         a type reprenst two things about a variable
         what type of data allowed to store
         how much memory is required to store a data
         
   types of data in python:
                                                         
              
          numeric                 dictionary    boolean     set      sequence type
          int,float,complex                                         string,list,tuple
               
            int:whole number may be negative or positive
            float:it is real number with floating pont representation(decimal number)
            complex:it has real part and imginary part(ex:2+3j)
            
             dictionary:diffrent types of meaning in particular words.we can add the words but cannot change existing one.
             (ex)a={1:'test',2:'prac')
             >>a[2] 
             o/p is prac
             
             boolean:it always check the condition and produce output true or false
             
             set: in python unordered collection of data that is iteratable..mutable and has no duplicate elements.
             its performs union intersection,diffrence
             Ex: a=set() 
             
             string:collection of one or more characters.anything between(' ' " " ) is represented as string.
             it has single line mutline representation.
             (Ex)
             a="char"
             b"10"
             c='m'
             
             list: which is ordered collection of data.its very flexible ,items in the list do not be in same type.
             represented in [] ,list is mutable.either we can test true or false
             ex
             list['10","c","python"]
             
             tuple: tuple is immutable,you cannot change ,add or remove the elements,it is a unique constraints.
             
             
             
   FUNCTION:
   In Python, a function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.

Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.

Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable.

       Reusuablity,once we write function that function called "n" of times
       easy debugging to find error
       
   function definition
       every function should start with 'def' keyword
       
   function name should not equal to keyword
   Every function name ends with:
      Every function will return by empty or value
         * in python declartion of function not necessary
   arguments/parameters should be equal to function definition
   
   example for user defined function :
      
        def add(a,b):
        sum=a+b
        print("sum")
        
   INBUILT FUNCTION:
      built in function are predefined function 
      in python we have 68 builtin function
       example:
       >>a= "hello"
       captilize function:
         
       >>a.capitalize
      
      in built functions in string:
captalize function:it makes capital in the first letter of string.syntax:string.capitalize()
centre function: example: string.centre(width,fill char)
endswith: it checks end of the string works like boolean expression(true or false):syntax:string.endswith(str,beg,end)
         example prg: a.endswith("x",0,len(a))
count: its used to count the length of string :example:str.count(str,beg,end)
index()
lower()
higher()
is title()
max()
min()
 
 KEYWORDS
  
        Keywords are predefined words given  by the interpreter
        each one has own identity and specific task
        there are 33 keywords in python
  rules:variable name shpuld not match with keyword
  
  some reserved keywords are:
  
  and: it performs logic and(compare two conditions)
  break:its used to terminate variable name in loop
  del: it is used delete the elements from list
  def: user defined function
  elif: else if function for mutiple function
  else:false statement
  except: it is used for exception handling
  class: its used for object oriented programm
  exec: its excute the python program dynamically
  finally: its similar like exec
  for: loop statement
  global: variable for both main anduser defined function
  if:for condition
  import: this keyword import the package to python program( ex: import.math)
  in: membership operator
  is:identity operator
  from: importing the subpackages
  
  
  DATA STRUCTURE:
         INT
         FLOAT 
         STRING -  "   " anything between colon consider as string
         
         LIST
         TUPLE
         SET
         DICTIONARY
         
         LIST: [] any thing between square bracket consider as list,list is mutable(changable) and can check true or false
         TUPLE: Tuple is immutable, cant change,add or remove the element.it is unique constraints
         SET: set() is a union ,intersection and difference,in set we can use either list or tuple.
         
         DICTIONARY: different types of meanings for particular word like our normal dictionary.we can add but can change existing.
                    {} used in dictinary
               
        MODULE/LIBRARY:
              In module contains both function and variable
       'n' no of function=module, 'n no of module=package, 'n' no og package=library       
         packages: a python package refers directly python modules,modules of one type at one place
         python packages collection of module under the common names space,this name space is created via directory that contains all related modules
         
         LIBRARY: satndard libraries are
                     math module,random module,statistics module
                     numpy library(no library)
                     scipy library(science library)
                     mathplotlib library(mathplot libarary)
                     tkinter library(ui based application)
         collection of various libraries is called frame work/
         
        INDEX:
            List elements can be accessed by index
            induivual elements in list can be accessed using an index in square bracket
            ex; my list[m]
            list indexing is zero based(its starts from zero only)
                 0     1     2     3
         ex: a=['cat','mat','rat','egg']
         >>>a[2]
         o/p is 'rat'
        SLICING:
               omitting the first and last index
               omitting the first inder:a[:n]
               omitting the last indexa[m:]
               both indexs :a[:]  written the copy of entire list
               skip index:a[0:3]
               
         IDENTIFIER  
             
             it is used to identify the elements(name in python program is called identifier)
              example: variable,classes,objects,modules,functions and constants
            
         Rules:
            Variable name should not match with keywords(ex:for,if)
            every identifier name should start with either character or underscore(_)
            variable name can be alphanumeric
            variable name is casesensitive
            The variable name should not start with digit(123)
            no length limit restriction for identifier
            
       OPERATOR
           operators are the symbol wwhich tells the python interpreter to do some mathematical or logical operation
           
           types of operator:
               assignment operator(=)
               arithmetic operator(+ -  * / = % += -+ *+ /= %=)
               relational operators(<  <= > >=  ==  !=)
               logical operators(! && ||)
               bitwise operator(&  |  ~ ^ << >> <<= >>= &= + ^+)
               increment and decrement operators(++ --)
               
            Python follows PEDMAS
            
                paranthesis(...)
                exponents(**)
                multiplicatin and division(* / // %)
                Addition and subraction( + -)
                
                COMPARISION OPERATORS:
                (== !+ <> , .  >= <=)
                
            Membership operators 
            
               test for membership in a sequence,such as string,list or  tuples,
                there are two membership operators
                     in(evaluates to true if its find a variable in a specified sequence)
                     not in(evaluates to true if its does not  find a variable in a specified sequence)
                     
                iDENTITY OPERATORS
                   identity operators compare the memory location of two objects.
                   
                   they  are
                   is(evaluates t0 true if the variable on either side of the operator point to the same object and false otherwise)
                   is not((evaluates to false if the variable on either side of the operator point to the same object and true otherwise)

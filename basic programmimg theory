  VARIABLE
      variable are container for storing data values.
      python has no command for decalaring variable
      A variable is created the moment u first assign a value to it
      ex:
      x=5
      y="ram"
      print(X)
      print(y)
      casting:
      if you want specify the data type of variable
      ex: x=strstr(3),o/p x='3'
      y=int(3),o/p y=3
      z+float(3),o/p z=3.0
      in costant you cant change the memory location
      in variable you may change,we can assign value to the variable or we can re assign value to the same vriBLE(we can update the variable)
 DATA TYPE:                 
       They are variable use to reserve some space 
       in memoryA representation of data(int,float,char)
       is mandatory in use data type for variable
       a type reprenst two things about a variable
         what type of data allowed to store
         how much memory is required to store a data
   types of data:
        primitive                                                      non primitive
              
      boolean     numeric                                                   string,array
                charcter                 integral                           structure,classes,etc..
                                       integer    floating point              
                                        byte           float
                                        short           double
                                        int
                                        long
   FUNCTION:
       Reusuablity,once we write function that function called n"n" of times
       easy debugging to find error
   function definition
       every function should start with 'def' keyword
       
   function name should not equal to keyword
   Every function name wnds with:
   Every function will return by empty or value
   * in python declartion of function not necessary
   arguments/parameters should be equal to function definition
   example for user defined function :
        def add(a,b):
        sum=a+b
        print("sum")
   INBUILT FUNCTION:
      built in function are predefined function 
      in python we have 68 builtin function
       example:
       >>a= "hello"
       captilize function:
         
       >>a.capitalize

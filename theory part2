in built functions in string:
captalize function:it makes capital in the first letter of string.syntax:string.capitalize()
centre function: example: string.centre(width,fill char)
endswith: it checks end of the string works like boolean expression(true or false):syntax:string.endswith(str,beg,end)
         example prg: a.endswith("x",0,len(a))
count: its used to count the length of string :example:str.count(str,beg,end)
index()
lower()
higher()
is title()
max()
min()
 
 KEYWORDS
        Keywords are predefined words given  by the interpreter
        each one has own identity and specific task
  rules:variable name shpuld not match with keyword
  some reserved keywords are:
  
  and: it performs logic and(compare two conditions)
  break:its used to terminate variable name in loop
  del: it is used delete the elements from list
  def: user defined function
  elif: else if function for mutiple function
  else:false statement
  except: it is used for exception handling
  class: its used for object oriented programm
  exec: its excute the python program dynamically
  finally: its similar like exec
  for: loop statement
  global: variable for both main anduser defined function
  if:for condition
  import: this keyword import the package to python program( ex: import.math)
  in: membership operator
  is:identity operator
  from: importing the subpackages
  
  
  DATA STRUCTURE:
         INT
         FLOAT 
         STRING -  "   " anything between colon consider as string
         
         LIST
         TUPLE
         SET
         DICTIONARY
         
         LIST: [] any thing between square bracket consider as list,list is mutable(changable) and can check true or false
         TUPLE: Tuple is immutable, cant change,add or remove the element.it is unique constraints
         SET: set() is a union ,intersection and difference,in set we can use either list or tuple.
         
         DICTIONARY: different types of meanings for particular word like our normal dictionary.we can add but can change existing.
                    {} used in dictinary
               
        MODULE/LIBRARY:
              In module contains both function and variable
       'n' no of function=module, 'n no of module=package, 'n' no og package=library       
         packages: a python package refers directly python modules,modules of one type at one place
         python packages collection of module under the common names space,this name space is created via directory that contains all related modules
         
         LIBRARY: satndard libraries are
                     math module,random module,statistics module
                     numpy library(no library)
                     scipy library(science library)
                     mathplotlib library(mathplot libarary)
                     tkinter library(ui based application)
         collection of various libraries is called frame work/
